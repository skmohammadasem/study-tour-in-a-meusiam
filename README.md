A museum arranged a day long program for some school children in which students can participate in various activities. So, all students may not be able to watch it at the same time. Some students have to wait unless they get 3D glasses. Using POSIX threads, mutex locks, and semaphores implement a solution that synchronizes the activities of the students. The total number of students, the number of 3D glasses are passed as command line arguments. Once a student thread finish watching the movie, it should terminate. Once all the student threads are terminated, the main program should be terminated. Program should work for any number of students and 3D glasses.
